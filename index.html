        I am a cyber security student. I enjoy the process of learning new skills and gaining technical 
        skills. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, golfing and playing guitar. I can 
        also play the mandolin and banjo, but I am not as proficient with those instruments as I am with
        the guitar.
