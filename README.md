# About Me 

> I served 6 years in the US Navy as a nuclear machinist mate
 on board The **Mighty Warship Hartford**, a fast attack submarine 
 in Groton CT. After I got out of the Navy my family and I
 moved to NC and I started worked at Carolina Handling
 servicing electric forklifts. I did that for about 4 years,
 and I left Carolina Handling to work for Siemens.
 I have worked here for just under 6 years where I currently 
 work as a remote service specialist, working on building 
 automation systems. My goal is to take the skills learned 
 in this academic path and apply them to my current role.

## Websites I Recommend
 1. [WRAL Weather](https://www.wral.com/weather/) The older I get the
 the more frequent I check the weather and WRAL is by far the most 
 accurate for local weather.  
 2. [Bleepingcomputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/) I like to
 check this website periodically, just to see what is going on in the 
 world of security threats.
